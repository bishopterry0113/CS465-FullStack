# CS465-FullStack

# Architecture
In my full stack project, I utilized different types of frontend development, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA). The customer-facing site was initially developed using Express HTML but was later converted to a .hbs view for improved rendering speeds. HTML, being static and client-facing, lacks the ability to interact with backend databases for dynamic updates. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a versatile language used for both frontend and backend development, allowing for the addition of dynamic elements to webpages. I used JavaScript to pull trip information from a MongoDB database, enabling the page to change dynamically based on user interaction. Lastly, the single-page application approach was employed, which avoids full page refreshes and provides a more seamless, native application-like experience for users.

# Why NoSQL MongoDB for the backend?
A NoSQL MongoDB database was chosen for the backend due to its flexibility in modifying schemas to accommodate scaling and functional changes. Its non-relational nature allows for easy horizontal scalability, making it a suitable choice for rapidly expanding systems.

# Functionality
JSON, different from JavaScript, acts as a standardized format for object data that can be easily interpreted by JavaScript to create literal JavaScript objects. JSON serves as the bridge between frontend and backend development by facilitating the storage and retrieval of data. By using JSON, frontend requests can be fulfilled with the appropriate data stored on the backend, eliminating the need to store duplicate data for different use cases.

# Code Refactoring and Reusable UI Components
During the full stack development process, code was refactored to improve functionality and efficiency. One example is the refactoring of the trip card and trip list components. Instead of rendering the same information separately, each trip is rendered as part of the whole, enhancing the overall functionality of the site. Reusable UI components offer several benefits, including reduced application size, faster development processes, and decreased chances of introducing errors and vulnerabilities (provided the components are secure).

# Testing
Testing endpoints in a full stack application involves various API testing methods, which become more challenging when additional security layers are in place. Prior to adding security, endpoints can be tested by directly accessing the localhost web address for the API endpoint or using tools like Postman, which enable testing with security measures and inputs to simulate authenticated access.

# Understanding Methods, Endpoints, and Security
In the context of a full stack application, the methods employed play a pivotal role in shaping the functionality and behavior of a webpage. Essential HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE are leveraged to interact with the database, enabling data retrieval or modification. These methods are executed through corresponding backend functions such as .create, .findOne, .find, and .findOneAndUpdate, which handle the implementation of the methods. As a result, endpoints emerge as the outcomes or responses generated by these methods, observable by administrators or clients. By thoroughly testing these endpoints, the application ensures the correct operation of functionality, accurate data display, and proper error handling. To safeguard the integrity and security of the database, protective measures are implemented to prevent unauthorized access or unauthorized modifications to the endpoints, thereby thwarting any unauthorized tampering with the database.

# Reflection
This course has significantly contributed to my professional development and helped me clarify my career goals. Balancing full-time work and studies, I had been uncertain about my career direction, preferred languages, and whether I wanted to focus on front-end or back-end development. This course has provided valuable insights and helped me narrow down my career path while highlighting the additional skills I need to pursue to become a competitive candidate in the job market. One crucial skill I've developed is a better understanding of how different code modules or components integrate to build a complete product.
